## CLI made with Cobra 
Docs on [cobra](https://umarcor.github.io/cobra/) and the [source code](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)

### Make on windows? 
Just use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and get Linux straign to your Windows!

Or, you could go with `winget install GnuWin32.Make` and add PATH `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin` to windows environment variables. Some of the commands won't work properly though as I could not bothered :P
